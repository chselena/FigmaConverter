Figma Converter: 
Convert any Figma design file into clean, positioned HTML + CSS that visually matches the original design. 

This tool fetches a Figma file using a Personal Access Token, normalizes the Figma node tree, and generates:
index.html — Fully wrapped HTML with a phone simulator container
styles.css — Reconstructed layout, absolute positioning, gradients, colors, borders, text styles
Accurate rendering of your Figma frame directly in your browser
The goal is to replicate the Figma design as closely as possible using raw HTML & CSS.

Installion:
git clone your-repo-url
cd FigmaConverter
npm install
export FIGMA_API_TOKEN="YOUR_FIGMA_API_TOKEN_HERE"
npm start
input your figma file link
open output/index.html
